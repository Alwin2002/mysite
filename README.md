# Description

This django project is the smallest of the projects that developer can built . I have built this project using book called "Django for Beginners".
It is just a simple blog applications build using django as a backend. I have built frontend using non-attractive css . I built this project as a first step
of learning django framework. In this blog application , there are couple of blogs in the home page . There is a provision to add blog, delete existing ones , and edit blogs.
There is also login page , signup page added to it which is boiler plate code of django. Looking forward to build more projects.....
